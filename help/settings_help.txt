The purpose of this file is to explain how to configure settings files.
All settings files are contained in the folder 'settings'.
Settings files are in the '.yml' format. Visit 'https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation' for more information.

const - The constants that will be used in the PDE itself
  L0 - Convex splitting constant
  L1 - Elastic energy constant L1
  L2 - Elastic energy constant L2
  L3 - Elastic energy constant L3
  A - Bulk energy constant A
  B - Bulk energy constant B
  C - Bulk energy constant C
  ep - The bulk energy is scaled by a factor of 1/ep^2. So as ep gets smaller, the end time needs to be increased

meshdata - Specific data corresponding to the mesh being used
  file_path - Specify the path to the mesh .msh file
  numnodes_init - For manufactured solution, the number of nodes in each dimension of the unit cube mesh
  numnodes_max - For manufactured solution, the maximum allowable number of nodes in each dimension of the unit cube mesh

options - Take boolean values
  omit_init_printoff - If 'true', omits the initial printoff of the settings
  visualize - If 'true', creates a Paraview file to visualize the data
  manufactured - If 'true', manufactures a solution, creates a unit cube mesh, and loops through different numbers of degrees of freedom

paraview - Specifies any paraview settings that need to be configured
  file_path - paraview/q-tensor-3d.pvd

solverdata - Settings specific to the PDE solver being used
  ksp_type - Krylov subspace method, use 'cg' (conjugate gradient) for symmetric positive definite matrices
  pc_type - Preconditioner type

timedata - Specifies the time step of the time-dependent PDE and the end time
  time_step
  end_time

userfunc - Allows the user to enter custom functions using Sympy notation with the 'sp.' prefix
  boundary - Where do we want the vector to physically point on the boundary? Example: sp.Matrix([x0-10,x1-10,x2-10])/sp.sqrt((x0-10)**2 + (x1-10)**2 + (x2-10)**2 + 1e-10)
  initialGuess - What is our initial guess for the solution to the PDE?
